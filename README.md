# Web503-Josh-Moss

<br />

## WeekOne 


For our first class this week in Web503 we had a look into the course outline and the assessments that are required this semester.
The last class was similar. We then made tables that had the assessment information for this semester as a little activity.
One little problem I have come across today was using breakpoints. I knew that you could use them in HTML but I was unaware
they also worked in markdown.
