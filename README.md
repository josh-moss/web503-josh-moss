# Web503-Josh-Moss

<br />

## WeekOne 

```markdown
For our first class this week in Web503 we had a look into the course outline 
and the assessments that are required this semester.The last class was similar. 
We then made tables that had the assessment information for this semester as a 
little activity. One little problem I have come across today was using breakpoints. 
I knew that you could use them in HTML but I was unaware they also worked in markdown.
